## Credit

First things first, this library is very heavily based on [Vinyl][vinyl]. Thank you to the [gulp.js][gulp] team for the inspiration and great ideas behind vinyl. This work is based on that.


## Comparison to Vinyl

The API for path handling is close enough that you can use Vinyl's docs as a reference. There are only a couple of minor differences:

1. Streams are not supported on `file.contents` by default. See [how to add streams](#how-to-add-stream-support).
2. Dirent extends Node's native [fs.Dirent](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_dirent) class.
3. You can pass a string or object as the first argument, and a [file type](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_file_type_constants) as the second argument.

## Usage

```js
const Dirent = require('{%= name %}');

// Pass a file path as a string, or an object with properties to add to the dirent
// The following examples are equivalent. When the path is a string, it will
// be converted to an object and set on the dirent.path property.
console.log(new Dirent('some/file/path.txt'));
console.log(new Dirent({ path: 'some/file/path.txt' }));
```

## How to add stream support

Stream support is added using the [cloneable-readable][] library (this is the same library used by Vinyl). To add support for streams, do the following:

```js
const clonable = require('cloneable-readable');
const Dirent = require('dirent');
const File = Dirent.create(cloneable);

const file = new File({ path: 'foo.js' });
```
