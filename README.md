> Virtual file class. Extends the native fs.Dirent class with methods to simplify path handling. Similar to Vinyl, but lightweight.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >=10):

```sh
$ npm install --save dirent
```

## Credit

This library is very heavily based on [Vinyl](https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl). Thank you to the [gulp.js](https://github.com/gulpjs) team for the inspiration and great ideas behind vinyl. This work is based on that.

## Comparison to Vinyl

The API for path handling is close enough that you can use Vinyl's docs as a reference. There are only a couple of minor differences:

1. Streams are not supported on `file.contents` by default. See how to [add stream support](#how-to-add-stream-support).
2. Dirent extends Node's native [fs.Dirent](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_dirent) class.
3. You can pass a string or object as the first argument, and optionally a [file type](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_file_type_constants) as the second argument.

## Usage

```js
const Dirent = require('dirent');

// Pass a file path as a string, or an object with properties to add to the dirent
// The following examples are equivalent. When the path is a string, it will
// be converted to an object and set on the dirent.path property.
console.log(new Dirent('some/file/path.txt'));
//=> <Dirent "some/file/path.txt">
console.log(new Dirent({ path: 'some/file/path.txt' }));
//=> <Dirent "some/file/path.txt">

// assuming __filename is /jonschlinkert/dev/dirent/index.js
const file = new Dirent(__filename);
console.log(file.dirname); //=> /Users/jonschlinkert/dev//dirent
console.log(file.basename); //=> example.js
console.log(file.stem); //=> example
console.log(file.extname); //=> .js
```

## How to add stream support

Stream support is added using the [cloneable-readable](https://github.com/mcollina/cloneable-readable) library (this is the same library used by Vinyl). To add support for streams, do the following:

```js
const clonable = require('cloneable-readable');
const Dirent = require('dirent');
const File = Dirent.create(cloneable);

const file = new File({ path: 'foo.js' });
```
